# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my **CTF (Capture The Flag)** writeups repository! 🚀  
In this repository, you will find my personal solutions to various **CTF challenges** from 2025, spanning across multiple categories like **Reverse Engineering**, **Web Exploitation**, **Forensics**, **Cryptography**, and more. Whether you're an aspiring CTF player or an experienced hacker looking for inspiration, this collection will give you a deep dive into the art of solving CTF challenges.

## What is CTF?

Capture The Flag (CTF) is a type of cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to earn points. The challenges range from reverse engineering, web exploitation, cryptography, to forensics, all designed to test your knowledge and skills in different areas of cybersecurity. Each challenge often has a flag, a hidden string of text, that participants need to find to score points.

## What's Inside

Here, you'll find writeups of the challenges I've solved in various CTF events in 2025, including:
- **Reverse Engineering**: Breaking down binaries, analyzing stack overflows, and understanding complex code.
- **Web Exploitation**: SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other web security challenges.
- **Forensics**: Investigating digital footprints in network captures (PCAP), disk images, and more.
- **Cryptography**: Cracking cryptographic algorithms, decoding ciphers, and breaking hashes.
