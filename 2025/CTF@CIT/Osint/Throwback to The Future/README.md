but the anthony gave information that the winner of this match was the team that had the stadium in the match which was the New Englands Patriot "`The MVP still can’t beat us when we’re at home 🤦‍♂️🤷`"

After researching the game that these two teams played in which New England won, I found the exact time when this photo was taken ,  which is in the 2023 NFL finals. 23/10/2023.
